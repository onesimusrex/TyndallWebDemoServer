Planning for \r construction waste management (CWM) before construction allows time to identify the most effective \r waste diversion strategies available. Such strategies typically include reuse, recycling, donation, and \r salvage; however, source reduction and source separation are also viable and effective. Source reduction \r eliminates project waste through prefabrication, modular construction, or incorporating standard material \r lengths or sizes into construction documents. Source separation sorts waste onsite into recycling \r streams, ensuring delivery to the correct facility. Retaining construction and demolition materials onsite \r reduces the cost of disposal at a landfill. Rather than viewing them as �waste,� using construction and \r demolition materials as resources for new site development reduces the need for and costs associated \r with purchasing new materials such as wood, concrete and other types of masonry, and drywall. \r \r All projects must develop and implement a Construction and Demolition Waste Management Plan \r (CDWMP). The CDWMP must account for all materials, including land-clearing debris, materials to be \r used for alternative daily cover (ADC), and other materials not contributing to diversion but not included in \r the diverted waste total. Material sent to landfills for use as cover is still being disposed of in landfills and \r therefore does not meet the intent of this effort. The safe removal and disposal of hazardous materials \r must also be covered in the CDWMP. Hazardous materials must be tracked separately and not be \r included in the project�s total waste. \r \r � \r Horizontal projects must pursue an overall diversion rate of at least 50% of structural materials, and \r 75% of road and infrastructure materials. \r � \r Vertical projects must pursue an overall diversion rate of at least 85%, attained through any \r combination of strategies appropriate to the project type and scope. \r Diversion rate = (Total waste diverted from landfill / Total waste produced by project) � 100 \r � \r Establish waste diversion goals for the project by identifying at least five materials (both structural and \r nonstructural) targeted for diversion. Approximate a percentage of the overall project waste that these \r materials represent. \r � It may be easiest to focus on determining the heaviest waste or the waste that generates the \r most volume. \r � For Horizontal projects, common materials that may be simple to divert include materials \r composted onsite or sent to a composting facility, the use of material, if appropriate, as infill, \r Portland cement concrete, and ferrous and non-ferrous metals. \r � \r Non-composted and non-organic materials should not be added to soil as an amendment \r unless these materials can be demonstrated to benefit site soils and planned vegetation. \r � For Vertical projects, common materials that may be simple to divert include drywall, acoustical \r ceiling tiles, carpet and other flooring, wood, scrap metals, brick, and concrete. \r � \r Finish materials, such as flooring and ceiling tiles, can often be recycled through the major \r manufacturers via take-back programs. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r � \r Consider incorporating reuse of finish materials, furniture, or framing into the design early. \r Reusing existing materials may require design modifications. Some materials must remain \r intact to be reused (for example, drywall) or may require additional preparation (for example, \r de-nailing). \r � Source reduction strategies should be incorporated into the design of the project and outlined in \r the CWM plan. These strategies include modular construction, reduced packaging, using \r industry-standard measurements, and prefabrication. \r � \r Specify whether materials will be separated or commingled at the project site and describe the \r diversion strategies planned for the project. Describe where the material will be taken and how the \r recycling facility will process the material. \r � Projects may use a combination of onsite separation and commingled collection, depending on \r what is appropriate for the project location, material stream, and available facilities and haulers. \r � \r For onsite separation, common CWM strategies include donation, resale, onsite reuse, \r recycling, or refurbishment. Crushing asphalt, concrete, and masonry for infill or aggregate is \r also considered onsite waste diversion. \r � \r The most common offsite strategies are incineration, combustion of wood, and sending \r commingled waste to a sorting facility. Include wood waste converted to fuel (biofuel) in the \r calculations; other types of waste-to-energy are not considered diversion for this effort. \r � Establish onsite infrastructure, practices, and policies for offsite sorting, and develop a tracking \r system. \r � \r Track all the construction and demolition waste leaving the site. Retain waste hauler reports for \r documentation.

That individual should have at least 5 years of S+R experience applicable to the project \r type. Depending on the project type and scope, one individual may serve as the S+R coordinator; for \r larger or more complex projects, multiple individuals may be needed. The individual should guide the \r project team through the design and construction phases, interfacing with the construction team�s S+R \r coordinator to ensure compliance and continuity. The individual should also work with the Tyndall AFB \r project manager throughout the life of the project to ensure full compliance and accountability. \r \r Project Process \r \r A Sustainability and Resiliency Management Plan (SRMP) enables a project to set goals, objectives, and \r policies; instigate plans and programs; review performance against a plan; and take corrective actions \r across the full dimensions of sustainability. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \r 14004 standard for social and environmental management plans provides guidance on developing a \r Sustainability Management Plan. SRMPs should include design and construction and should allow for \r continued operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project for aspects that extend past project turnover. \r \r SRMPs may be stand-alone or incorporated into larger management plans. For smaller projects, \r sustainability management policies may be sufficient. The SRMP must manage the scope, scale, and \r complexity of the project�s S+R goals and describe how each must be met. The assessment is based on \r the organizational policies, authorities, mechanisms, education, and business processes put in place \r along with a determination of sufficiency. \r \r The SRMP must have the minimum following components: \r \r � \r Organizational charts and documentation showing the personnel responsible for project S+R issues, \r their position in the project organization, and their authority to make project decisions and affect \r change. \r � \r An index of all project features related to sustainability and resiliency and all aspects that require \r tracking, reporting, or other documentation. \r � \r Assessment of the project�s environmental, economic, and social impacts. This may include the \r potential for existing, non-sustainable conditions to further deteriorate environmental, economic, or \r social conditions if left unaddressed. \r 04 � \r Prioritized list of project goals, objectives, and performance targets that consider project importance \r and the consequences of change. Goals should be aligned to objectives and targets that meet \r community needs and issues. \r � \r Documentation of a robust plan-do-check-act methodology to identify priorities, evaluate progress, \r and make adjustments to continually improve project S+R performance. \r � \r Identification of potential areas where changes in key design variables may impact future project \r performance related to S+R. Include evidence that the SRMP accounts for these potential changes \r and is adaptable. \r � \r Documentation of how the S+R requirements will be communicated to the Design Team and verified \r with the Tyndall AFB project manager. \r � \r Documentation that regular monitoring and reporting of progress against the SRMP�s goals and \r objectives is occurring throughout the design phase (for example, meetings or written reports). \r � \r Plans for how the S+R requirements will be communicated and transitioned from the design phase to \r the construction phase through methods such as construction plans, daily job briefings, subcontractor \r orientations, or onsite field training sessions. \r To create the SRMP, the S+R coordinator must develop a list of all the environmental, economic, and \r social aspects of the project that relate to sustainability and resiliency. Once established, the list of \r aspects is prioritized by the project team based on the importance of meeting project requirements. There \r may be some variations depending on the project size, type, and complexity. The SRMP must have clear \r processes and controls in place to achieve the requirements (that is, the SRMP is not solely aspirational \r in nature). Implementation of the SRMP must be revisited throughout the design phase and should be \r updated as needed and submitted as part of each major milestone submittal to Tyndall AFB. The SRMP \r should recognize that changes in socioeconomic and environmental conditions have the potential to \r significantly impact projects. SRMPs and their subsequent performance goals take these changing \r conditions into account. \r \r Starting in pre-design, but no later than the start of the conceptual design phase, the project�s S+R \r coordinator must develop the initial SRMP document. The SRMP should encompass all aspects related \r to the design phase of the project and should also plan for the integration of the contractor. At the start of \r the construction phase, the SRMP should be transferred to the contractor where it must then update the \r content with how the construction team intends to assimilate the SRMP components and execute all \r requirements. The contractor should provide the updated version to the Design Team�s S+R Coordinator \r and to the Tyndall AFB project manager. The contractor�s coordinator must provide regular updates to the \r same individuals throughout the construction phase, as well as a final version including end results of all \r initiatives to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. \r \r","keywords":[{"text":"exception of individual building projects","relevance":0.699877},{"text":"Integrative design process","relevance":0.598374},{"text":"building \r projects","relevance":0.589563},{"text":"new construction","relevance":0.579208},{"text":"s S","relevance":0.579078},{"text":"Resiliency Management Plan","relevance":0.574797},{"text":"Energy efficiency","relevance":0.573786},{"text":"Tyndall \r AFB Installation Facility Standards","relevance":0.572549},{"text":"Tyndall Air Force Base","relevance":0.571348},{"text":"vertical projects types","relevance":0.556981},{"text":"construction phases","relevance":0.554444},{"text":"renovation projects","relevance":0.552989},{"text":"construction team","relevance":0.543894},{"text":"Adaptive design","relevance":0.543286},{"text":"organizational policies","relevance":0.54131},{"text":"Environmental tobacco smoke control","relevance":0.540078},{"text":"renewable energy","relevance":0.536902},{"text":"design phase","relevance":0.536114},{"text":"Minimization of construction impacts","relevance":0.53292},{"text":"indoor environmental quality","relevance":0.532225},{"text":"Consideration of future needs","relevance":0.532132},{"text":"Support of mental restoration","relevance":0.531155},{"text":"Traffic emissions reduction","relevance":0.529413},{"text":"Context-sensitive project delivery","relevance":0.529335},{"text":"Control of invasive species","relevance":0.529177},{"text":"Life-cycle impact reduction","relevance":0.528582},{"text":"Outdoor water use reduction","relevance":0.52812},{"text":"Long-term management of biodiversity","relevance":0.527999},{"text":"R experience","relevance":0.526925},{"text":"Tyndall AFB \r project manager","relevance":0.526544}],"concepts":[{"text":"Project management","relevance":0.968852},{"text":"Construction","relevance":0.841877},{"text":"Sustainability","relevance":0.625728},{"text":"Design","relevance":0.621731},{"text":"Tyndall Air Force Base","relevance":0.566168},{"text":"Water","relevance":0.553761},{"text":"Universal design","relevance":0.468483},{"text":"Management","relevance":0.419787},{"text":"Air pollution","relevance":0.4137},{"text":"Project","relevance":0.412735},{"text":"Plan","relevance":0.408409},{"text":"Indoor air quality","relevance":0.372712},{"text":"Project team","relevance":0.37048},{"text":"Elasticity","relevance":0.353993},{"text":"Environment","relevance":0.353105}]},{"_id":"5db224f8c4cc5d17f2922284","type":"subcategory","csi":"07 90 00","l1":"07","l2":"90","l3":"00","title":"JOINT PROTECTION \r","body":"\r Preconstruction Compatibility and Adhesion Testing \r \r Submit to the joint-sealant manufacturers eight samples of materials that will contact or affect joint \r sealants.

Although the CGP applies only to sites greater than one acre (0.40 hectare), its \r requirements are applied to all Tyndall AFB projects. \r \r Recommended Strategies \r \r Employ strategies such as a combination of temporary and permanent seeding, mulching, earth dikes, \r sediment traps, sediment basins, filter socks, compost berms and blankets, secondary containment, spill \r control equipment, hazardous waste manifests, and overfill alarms. Include the following aspects, as \r appropriate to each project type: \r \r � \r Erosion and sedimentation control \r � Providing natural buffers \r � Installing perimeter controls \r � Minimizing sediment track-out \r � Controlling discharges from stockpiled sediment or soil \r � Minimizing dust \r � Minimizing the disturbance of steep slopes \r � Preserving topsoil \r � Minimizing soil compaction \r � Protecting storm drain inlets \r � \r Maintaining control measures \r o \r Stabilization \r � \r Deadlines for initiating and completing stabilization \r � \r Criteria for stabilization \r o \r Pollution prevention \r � \r Prohibited discharges \r � \r General maintenance requirements \r � \r Pollution prevention standards \r � \r Emergency spill notification \r � \r Fertilizer discharge restrictions \r � \r Implement post-construction stormwater management with construction \r sequencing (such as infiltration systems constructed or rehabilitated at the end of \r the project); account for weather conditions during construction activities to \r minimize unintended chemical dispersal or other adverse effects on and offsite \r (such as apply pavement sealers and perform mass-grading operations only \r when no rain is predicted) \r The contractor must establish control measures before construction begins and implement additional \r measures as needed based on site conditions and as construction progresses. The establishment and \r maintenance of ESCP measures are generally the responsibility of the general contractor or builder. At a \r minimum, the contractor must provide regular inspections and documentation updates to show progress. \r If any issues arise, the issue must be documented along with what remedial measures were implemented \r to alleviate the issue. \r \r � \r Monitor control measures periodically through site inspections and record maintenance activities \r taken during construction. \r � \r Inspections must be recorded regularly via date-stamped photographs, inspection reports, or other \r recording processes. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r actions are also recommended: \r \r � \r Any problems identified in site inspections should be resolved in a timely manner. \r � \r All subcontractors should promptly notify the responsible party if they see damage to an ESCP \r measure. \r � \r Generate and save documentation as the SWPPP or ESC is implemented for compilation in the final \r report. \r Submittal Documentation \r \r The Design Team must provide the following to the S+R Coordinator, and these must be a component of \r the final construction documents: \r \r � \r The SWPPP, ESCP, or other local required plan (whichever is more stringent). If a local standard has \r been followed, provide documentation to demonstrate the local standard is equal to or more stringent \r than the referenced NPDES program. \r � \r Site plan showing the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite. \r The contractor must provide the following construction-related content: \r \r � \r Key pollution prevention personnel and their responsibilities and qualifications \r � \r Schedule of activities for construction operations \r � \r A list of expected pollutants generated by construction operations \r � \r Relevant regulatory compliance information, including minimum effluent and air quality standards \r � \r Identification of buffers and potentially impacted bodies of water \r � \r Narrative describing the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite \r � For zero lot line projects and projects with minimal or no exterior work: Description of special \r conditions and compliance with any applicable ESCP measures \r � \r Video or photos that document the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite \r � \r Video or photos that document any issues that arise, as well as documentation showing their \r corrective actions; include information regarding the timeframe between initial offense and correction \r Final SWPPP/ESCP documentation must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. \r \r","keywords":[{"text":"Tyndall AFB projects","relevance":0.66604},{"text":"Pollutant \r Control Plan","relevance":0.639271},{"text":"construction stormwater pollution","relevance":0.626211},{"text":"Construction General Permit","relevance":0.621288},{"text":"discharge of construction site pollutants","relevance":0.59156},{"text":"control measures","relevance":0.577746},{"text":"public safety","relevance":0.575497},{"text":"air quality","relevance":0.571785},{"text":"sediment discharges","relevance":0.570539},{"text":"Relevant regulatory compliance information","relevance":0.561645},{"text":"Sedimentation Control Plan","relevance":0.558171},{"text":"Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan","relevance":0.557372},{"text":"work of other contractors","relevance":0.55523},{"text":"Design Team","relevance":0.554946},{"text":"Strategies \r \r Employ strategies","relevance":0.549367},{"text":"stormwater runoff","relevance":0.548415},{"text":"use of \r common soil stockpile areas","relevance":0.548008},{"text":"documentation updates","relevance":0.546623},{"text":"stormwater systems","relevance":0.545628},{"text":"zero lot line projects","relevance":0.542436},{"text":"construction activities","relevance":0.537839},{"text":"apply pavement sealers","relevance":0.53652},{"text":"weather conditions","relevance":0.536315},{"text":"construction sites","relevance":0.535249},{"text":"project size","relevance":0.530942},{"text":"corrective actions","relevance":0.529279},{"text":"sediment traps","relevance":0.528408},{"text":"sedimentation control standards","relevance":0.526564},{"text":"regular inspections","relevance":0.525289},{"text":"construction phase of the project","relevance":0.525245}],"concepts":[{"text":"Surface runoff","relevance":0.963451},{"text":"Pollution","relevance":0.845765},{"text":"Project management","relevance":0.643077},{"text":"Stormwater","relevance":0.628801},{"text":"Project","relevance":0.601011},{"text":"Architect","relevance":0.591742},{"text":"Construction","relevance":0.577433},{"text":"Sediment","relevance":0.577426},{"text":"Building","relevance":0.55796},{"text":"Water","relevance":0.54432},{"text":"Water pollution","relevance":0.536642},{"text":"Air pollution","relevance":0.509916},{"text":"Erosion","relevance":0.478706},{"text":"Project manager","relevance":0.473233},{"text":"Architecture","relevance":0.468591},{"text":"Clean Water Act","relevance":0.462597},{"text":"United States Environmental Protection Agency","relevance":0.446757},{"text":"Construction site safety","relevance":0.424695},{"text":"Building code","relevance":0.419175},{"text":"Infrastructure","relevance":0.400699}]},{"_id":"5db224f8c4cc5d17f2922287","type":"subcategory","csi":"08 12 10","l1":"08","l2":"12","l3":"10","title":"Factory-Applied Enamel Finish \r","body":"\r Provide coatings that meet test procedures and acceptance criteria in accordance with Steel Door \r Institute (SDI) A250.3.

Commercial buildings must be designed to achieve energy consumption levels that are 30% \r less than the consumption levels of the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 baseline building. \r \r New buildings and major renovations of existing buildings are to reduce fossil fuel-generated energy \r consumption 80% in FY 2020, 90% in FY 2025, and 100% in FY 2030, compared to a FY 2003 baseline. \r \r Federal low-rise residential buildings must be designed and constructed in compliance with the \r International Code Council 2015 International Energy Conservation Code. \r \r Install metering and advanced metering devices in accordance with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) \r Metering Guidance, November 2014, or subsequent updates. \r \r Achieving Best-In-Class energy performance is required and should include the following components: \r \r � \r Reduced operating costs through reduced energy consumption \r � \r Enhanced resilience through reduced requirements for energy and water \r � \r Enhanced resilience through passive survivability \r 04 � \r Downsizing of emergency generator and fuel storage equipment \r � \r Better and more durable buildings \r � \r Improved occupant comfort and productivity \r � \r Significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions \r � \r Simplification of powering buildings with renewable energy and energy storage \r � \r Mitigation of the risk of future energy cost volatility \r � \r Reduced maintenance burden \r � \r Mitigation of the risk of future climate changes such as greater peak cooling loads \r Tyndall AFB is in Climate Zone 2A, and it is cooling dominated. ASHRAE research and publications \r indicate that a target Energy Use Intensity at Tyndall AFB can be 22 thousand British thermal units per \r square foot (kBtu/ft2) per year, site energy, for a typical office building. Allowances can be made for the \r type of building, hours of operation, and USAF-driven process loads, but this is where best-in-class \r energy performance starts, and it is the baseline for energy performance. \r \r This level of energy performance is to be achieved through the use of integrated design strategies where \r all design, construction and operations personnel think of the building as a system, not as individual \r components. Interdisciplinary solutions must be identified that result in savings that dwarf component-\r based efficiencies. Well thought-out, cost-effective, simple-to-maintain strategies must result in the \r downsizing of HVAC equipment, artificial lighting, and electrical systems to provide low energy \r performance with a conventional budget. Energy modeling must be initiated early in the process, and the \r model must be continually updated as design options are considered and selected. \r \r In summary, the approach to achieving a low-energy-consuming building starts with the building \r envelope, where the interior environment is separated from the exterior. Buildings will include high �R� \r value, thermally broken, well air-sealed assemblies to minimize the skin load. Hygro-thermal analysis \r should be included to identify condensation and mold issues as well. Next, the internal loads created by \r USAF equipment must be as efficient as possible to minimize the energy requirements. Efficient heating, \r cooling, ventilation, and lighting are to be provided only where needed, when needed, and rarely for \r unoccupied spaces. Equipment to provide heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting must be high-\r efficiency type, and ventilation requirements should be separated from sensible heating and cooling. \r \r In Tyndall AFB�s climate zone, the cooling load can be expected to represent two thirds of a building�s \r energy consumption. Efforts to reduce the cooling loads must include the following: \r \r � \r Attention to orientation and massing. An east-west orientation significantly contributes to avoiding \r unwanted solar gain while providing opportunities for effective daylighting strategies that reduce the \r need for artificial lighting. \r � \r A window-to-wall ratio maximum of 30% with reduced glazing on the east and west facades \r compared to the north and south facades. Glazing must be well placed for daylighting and views. \r � \r Appropriate shading of fenestration to prevent solar gain and glare. \r � \r High R-value opaque wall assemblies. \r � \r Continuous exterior insulation to create a thermal break. This includes slabs and foundations, as well \r as roofs and wall assemblies. Pay attention to balconies, parapets, and similar. \r � \r Incorporating cool roofs. \r � \r A continuous air barrier throughout all six sides of the building. The air barrier must be tested in \r accordance with ASTM E779, and the infiltration must not exceed 0.15 cubic foot per minute per \r square foot (cfm/ft2) of envelope at 75 Pascals (Pa). \r � \r The lighting power density must be no more than 0.4 watt per square foot (ft2) for the overall building; \r for individual areas, the wattage per square foot must match the criteria as defined in ASHRAE/ \r Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) Standard 90.1. Lighting controls, to include occupancy \r sensors, photocell control, daylight harvesting, bilevel dimming, and similar, must minimize power \r consumption and eliminate lighting of unoccupied spaces. Use task lighting with vacancy sensors to \r supplement low ambient light levels. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r � \r Equipment and appliances must be ENERGY STAR rated, and careful attention must be paid to the \r reduction of plug loads through the optimization of office equipment, copy rooms, vending and \r kitchenettes. \r HVAC systems will vary based on building type and size. They must be right sized to avoid inefficient \r operation at part load, and they must be high-efficiency systems. The fact that a high-performance air \r barrier and envelope is required gives the HVAC system designer the confidence needed to downsize \r systems. Where possible, ventilation requirements must be decoupled from sensible heating \r requirements, and energy recovery ventilation must be used. Demand controlled ventilation must be used \r where appropriate, such as in often unoccupied assembly areas. Focus should be placed on simplifying \r systems and downsizing equipment through load reduction. An effort to minimize the maintenance \r requirements must be included through the use of simple strategies such as heat pipes for heat recovery. \r Economizers and free cooling must be used when possible. \r \r Service water heating loads must be minimized through water conservation. Plumbing fixtures must be \r Water Sense labelled with particular attention paid to fixtures using hot water. Compact plumbing plans \r must be provided where possible, and efficient service water heating equipment must be specified. \r \r","keywords":[{"text":"Energy Performance","relevance":0.664546},{"text":"Residential Buildings","relevance":0.653473},{"text":"Code of Federal Regulations","relevance":0.631107},{"text":"International Code Council","relevance":0.602165},{"text":"artificial lighting","relevance":0.592859},{"text":"Commercial buildings","relevance":0.590431},{"text":"square foot","relevance":0.586107},{"text":"Energy Efficiency Standards","relevance":0.575947},{"text":"target Energy Use Intensity","relevance":0.572138},{"text":"fuel storage equipment","relevance":0.569935},{"text":"loads \r Tyndall AFB","relevance":0.568684},{"text":"energy consumption levels","relevance":0.561204},{"text":"Multi-Family High-Rise","relevance":0.559285},{"text":"downsizing of HVAC equipment","relevance":0.557739},{"text":"International Energy Conservation Code","relevance":0.552884},{"text":"design strategies","relevance":0.552277},{"text":"Federal low-rise residential buildings","relevance":0.548115},{"text":"electrical systems","relevance":0.54419},{"text":"hours of operation","relevance":0.53996},{"text":"Downsizing of emergency generator","relevance":0.538262},{"text":"continuous air barrier","relevance":0.537709},{"text":"Appropriate shading of fenestration","relevance":0.537628},{"text":"lighting power density","relevance":0.534242},{"text":"building \r envelope","relevance":0.534026},{"text":"air-sealed assemblies","relevance":0.530835},{"text":"Mitigation of the risk of future climate changes","relevance":0.529732},{"text":"type of building","relevance":0.529305},{"text":"baseline building","relevance":0.529268},{"text":"major renovations","relevance":0.528657},{"text":"Tyndall AFB","relevance":0.52753}],"concepts":[{"text":"HVAC","relevance":0.978685},{"text":"Lighting","relevance":0.595071},{"text":"Energy conservation","relevance":0.578852},{"text":"Energy recovery","relevance":0.530571},{"text":"Efficient energy use","relevance":0.479145},{"text":"Heat recovery ventilation","relevance":0.46917},{"text":"Building engineering","relevance":0.441798},{"text":"Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning","relevance":0.40332},{"text":"Ventilation","relevance":0.385204},{"text":"Renewable energy","relevance":0.352206},{"text":"Indoor air quality","relevance":0.337564},{"text":"Energy recovery ventilation","relevance":0.331849},{"text":"Low-energy building","relevance":0.318122},{"text":"Infiltration","relevance":0.303281},{"text":"Energy policy","relevance":0.29463},{"text":"Peak oil","relevance":0.288988},{"text":"Energy","relevance":0.2882},{"text":"International Energy Agency","relevance":0.287248},{"text":"Cubic foot","relevance":0.280725},{"text":"Building","relevance":0.27155},{"text":"Sustainable energy","relevance":0.264107},{"text":"Office","relevance":0.257083},{"text":"Daylighting","relevance":0.256276},{"text":"Heat","relevance":0.246293},{"text":"Greenhouse gas","relevance":0.242018},{"text":"Fire protection","relevance":0.238727},{"text":"Occupancy","relevance":0.233556},{"text":"Heat exchanger","relevance":0.232477},{"text":"Architectural engineering","relevance":0.232035},{"text":"Sick building syndrome","relevance":0.230685}]},{"_id":"5db224f9c4cc5d17f292228f","type":"subcategory","csi":"08 43 00","l1":"08","l2":"43","l3":"00","title":"Storefronts \r","body":"\r Exterior storefront systems must be heavy-duty commercial quality aluminum systems with doors that \r swing outward.

Confirm compatibility and application with the sealant material manufacturer to confirm the \r proper type of sealant and installation. \r � \r Provide elastomeric sealants that comply with ASTM C 920 for joints between aluminum storefront \r and adjacent substrates, tilt-up panels, floor joints, and around plumbing fixtures. \r � \r All exterior precast tilt-up wall joints must be sealed full height of the joint (both sides). \r � \r Provide latex sealant that complies with ASTM C 834 for interior use at doors and windows. \r � \r Provide silicone sealant that complies with ASTM C 920 for exterior sealant for use in curtain walls. \r Floor Joint Sealer \r \r � \r The joint filler may separate from the edges when placed before the concrete is finished shrinking or if \r temperature inside the building has too great of a variance. \r � \r The joint filler must be replaced after the floor stops its movement. This should be considered a part \r of the Owner�s maintenance. \r All concrete horizontal and vertical construction joints (concrete, precast concrete, tilt up concrete) must \r have a concrete step detail that prevents water from being driven directly through the joint. \r \r All concrete vertical joints must have a lapped or keyed detail that prevents water from being driven \r directly through the joint. All joints must be properly prepared and sealed. \r \r Sealants must be applied to joints that incorporate step, lap, or key joints to further provide a positive \r weather seal. Sealant joint design, priming, tooling, masking, cleaning, and application must be in \r accordance with the general requirements of Sealants: A Professionals� Guide from the Sealant, \r Waterproofing & Restoration Institute (2013). All sealants must conform to ASTM C 920. \r \r Joints must include proper backing material for sealant support during application, control of sealant \r depth, and to act as a bond breaker. Use filler boards, backer rods, and bond breaker tapes. Confirm with \r the sealant manufacturer whether priming should be used. Applied sealant must be tooled. Tooling must \r not compact sealant less than the minimum sealant thickness required. Mask adjacent surfaces to control \r sealant boundaries during sealant application. \r \r 04 ","keywords":[{"text":"Joint sealants","relevance":0.970099},{"text":"building joints","relevance":0.750408},{"text":"sealant materials","relevance":0.650661},{"text":"sealant material manufacturer","relevance":0.600846},{"text":"joint \r system","relevance":0.597546},{"text":"vertical construction joints","relevance":0.596621},{"text":"proper type of sealant","relevance":0.593307},{"text":"concrete step detail","relevance":0.591839},{"text":"ASTM C","relevance":0.574917},{"text":"joint filler","relevance":0.574785},{"text":"exterior precast tilt","relevance":0.571634},{"text":"sealant","relevance":0.565241},{"text":"interior use","relevance":0.556287},{"text":"floor joints","relevance":0.554753},{"text":"elastomeric sealants","relevance":0.549653},{"text":"precast concrete","relevance":0.542923},{"text":"building envelope penetrations","relevance":0.537346},{"text":"incorporate step","relevance":0.536997},{"text":"latex sealant","relevance":0.535665},{"text":"wall joints","relevance":0.535613},{"text":"curtain walls","relevance":0.52797},{"text":"joints","relevance":0.52688},{"text":"general requirements of Sealants","relevance":0.526553},{"text":"lap","relevance":0.526268},{"text":"silicone sealant","relevance":0.525448},{"text":"key joints","relevance":0.525294},{"text":"full height of the joint","relevance":0.525057},{"text":"materials","relevance":0.521598},{"text":"accordance","relevance":0.521147},{"text":"tilt","relevance":0.519568}],"concepts":[{"text":"Sealant","relevance":0.986616},{"text":"Concrete","relevance":0.953731},{"text":"Firestop","relevance":0.802317},{"text":"Pinniped","relevance":0.785153},{"text":"Precast concrete","relevance":0.654881},{"text":"Silicone","relevance":0.647436},{"text":"Building","relevance":0.636169},{"text":"Materials","relevance":0.594902},{"text":"Adhesive","relevance":0.510937},{"text":"Materials science","relevance":0.508422},{"text":"Joint","relevance":0.497154},{"text":"Curtain wall","relevance":0.490618},{"text":"Tilt up","relevance":0.476833}]},{"_id":"5db224fac4cc5d17f2922293","type":"subcategory","csi":"08 46 00","l1":"08","l2":"46","l3":"00","title":"Window Wall Assemblies \r","body":"\r � \r Provide insulated low-E glazing set in aluminum frames. \r � \r Provide thermally broken aluminum frames. \r","keywords":[{"text":"low-E","relevance":0.802073},{"text":"aluminum frames","relevance":0.343575},{"text":"broken aluminum frames","relevance":0.320408}],"concepts":[]},{"_id":"5db224fac4cc5d17f2922294","type":"subcategory","csi":"08 42 00","l1":"08","l2":"42","l3":"00","title":"Entrances \r","body":"\r The DOR must coordinate the use of floor mat grilles with floor drains and trap primers, entrance \r vestibules, door and door frame weather seals, or other secondary means to prevent hurricane \r wind-driven rains from entering at the facility�s exterior entrances. \r \r All exterior door thresholds and window sills must have step detail that prevents water from being driven \r directly under door threshold/window sill.

Due to the phased nature of the project execution, some systems may be tested multiple times. \r The contractor must allow sufficient time in the project schedule for testing/re-testing systems \r involved in each turnover milestone. \r 3.10. CORRECTIVE ISSUE LOG \r A. The CxA will document all deficiencies discovered during the commissioning process on a \r Corrective Issue Log. The CxA will provide access to this log to the contractor for notification and \r action in correcting the deficiency. \r B. The CxA will enter all deficiencies into the commissioning progress tracking software. \r C. When the deficiency has been corrected, the contractor must note action taken in the software \r and notify the CxA when deficiency has been resolved. \r D. An updated Corrective Issues Log must be distributed at each Cx progress meeting, where \r progress to resolution will be reviewed. \r 3.11. OWNER TRAINING \r A. All training sessions must be coordinated through the CxA. The CxA will prepare a training form \r for each training session required by the contract documents and issue to the contractor. The \r training forms must be used to schedule, perform, and document the required training sessions. \r B. The contractor must complete the first section of the form including the proposed training session \r date, name of instructor(s), and proposed length (time) of the session(s). The contractor must \r 04 attach an agenda indicating the training session format and listing any handouts that will be \r provided. \r \r C. The CxA will review the proposed training information with the Owner. If the submitted information \r is complete, the CxA will respond to the contractor to proceed with scheduling the subject training \r session. \r D. A summary list of all anticipated training exercises to be provided is to be submitted for review by \r the contractor and updated throughout the project as required. Initial submittal should be made no \r later than the mid-point of construction, well in advance of any system turnover / training \r activities. All systems, sub-systems and equipment packages that will have manufacturer, vendor, \r or contractor demonstration or training exercises are to be listed with anticipated dates and \r duration. These events will be tracked and updated by the CxA and reported to the \r Commissioning Team when executed. \r E. After each Training Session is completed, the CxA will issue an Evaluation Form to each of the \r attendees. This feedback information will be provided to the Owner and Architect for review. \r F. Training Instructors must be a manufacturer�s representative or applications engineer fully \r qualified in the operation, troubleshooting and maintenance procedures for the equipment or \r systems being covered. Sales representatives or others possessing only general knowledge of \r the equipment or systems must not be acceptable. \r G. The following format must be used to schedule, perform, document, and evaluate the required \r training sessions: \r 1. The contractor must submit any changes to the previously approved Training Form for \r each training session required by the Contract Documents to the CxA. This form must be \r submitted a minimum of 14 calendar days in advance of the proposed training session. \r 2. The CxA will then review the proposed training information with the Owner. If the \r submitted information is complete and the proposed dates meet the Owner�s Operations \r Personnel schedule, the CxA will respond to the contractor to proceed with scheduling \r the subject training session. \r 3. During the training session, the contractor must record attendance for the training \r session. The contractor must then forward the Training Form and the Sign In Sheet to \r the CxA. \r 4. Upon receipt of the Training Form, the CxA will have each of the attendees complete the \r Evaluation Form to gain feedback on the value of the session. \r 5. If the session meets the objectives and intent of the contract documents, the CxA will \r approve the training form and return to the contractor for project records. \r 6. If negative feedback is received, Evaluation Forms will be reviewed with the \r Commissioning Team and if necessary, re-scheduling of the training may be required. \r H. O&M Manuals and accurate as-built drawings must be submitted and approved by the Architect \r and/or Owner BEFORE any training sessions will be held. The As-built drawings and O&M \r information will be reviewed and used as reference during training instructions. \r I. Professional quality videotaping of ALL project training is required. Refer to Section 01 79 00 \r Demonstration and Training. \r 3.12. DEFERRED, SEASONAL, AND OCCUPANCY PHASE COMMISSIONING \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r . PFCs, FPTs, and ISTs must be executed and documented during the project�s construction, \r testing, and acceptance phases, leading up to System Acceptance. The Occupancy/Warranty \r Phase occurs after System Acceptance. \r B. If any check or test cannot be completed due to the building structure, phasing, required \r occupancy condition, or other deficiency, execution of the FPTs or ISTs may be delayed upon \r approval from the Owner. These tests will be conducted during the occupancy phase, in the same \r manner as seasonal testing and as soon as possible. \r C. During the occupancy phase, seasonal FPTs or ISTs (tests delayed until ambient or occupancy \r conditions are closer to the system's design) must be completed as part of this contract. The CxA \r must coordinate this work in conjunction with the Owner and the contractor. Tests will be \r executed, documented and deficiencies identified and corrected in the same manner as noted for \r the tests conducted during the Construction and Testing Phase. Any final adjustments to the \r O&M manuals and as-built documents due to this testing are the responsibility of the contractors. \r D. Contractor must provide Building Automation System access credentials to the CxA so that the \r CxA may monitor building system performance. CxA access must allow enabling and modifying \r trends including adding/removing points, adjusting time frame and sampling rates, and \r printing/exporting trend data in a tabular format. CxA access must not allow alteration of set \r points or programming. \r E. 10 months into the typical 12-month warranty period, the CxA will reconvene the project team to \r meet with the Owner or representative and other designated Owner�s personnel. This meeting is \r intended to solicit the user comments, suggestions, and areas of concern regarding the systems \r and their first year of operation. The meeting will include review of any outstanding warranty, \r punch list, or Cx issues for resolution by the Design Team and/or Construction Team and \r assignment of responsibility for resolution. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r CONDITIONS \r \r Temporary shoring and bracing provided during structural demolition operations that occur during \r hurricane season must be designed to resist forces imposed on the supporting structure due to the \r program wind speed requirements (USAF, 2019a). When demolition operations fall outside of hurricane \r season, refer to the latest version of ASCE 37, Design Loads on Structures During Construction, for \r permitted wind loading. \r \r Typical construction standards for providing additional bracing or shoring in case of imminent storm must \r be allowed as long as the action plan is submitted at the beginning of the project and all materials are \r kept onsite. Harden all active construction sites and remove excess materials to minimize risk from \r damage of an imminent storm. \r \r","keywords":[{"text":"training session","relevance":0.667211},{"text":"C.

The OSHA also recommends this same standard for walking surfaces. \r The ADA recommends a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) for accessible routes and \r \r 0.80 for ramps. \r Scratch Hardness (Mohs Hardness): The relative hardness of glazed tile is an important issue that \r should be addressed when selecting tile. Scratch resistance of glazes is measured by scratching the \r surface of the tile with different minerals and assigning a �Mohs Scale Hardness� number to the glaze, the \r softest mineral used is talc (a rating of 1) and the hardest is a diamond (a rating of 10 if no scratch). Most \r glazes used on ceramic tile fall in the five to six range, which is also slightly harder than most steels. \r Case-hardened steel, such as what is used in drill bits, is approximately six and will scratch most glazes. \r Quartz, No. 7 on the Mohs scale, will scratch most glazes (sand is a common example of natural quartz). \r \r Tile is appropriate for all areas that may be subject to high foot traffic, wetness, and require the need for \r increased durability, for example, dining facilities, kitchens, break rooms, restrooms, entry lobbies, floors, \r walls, and similar. \r \r Technical Criteria: Select tile based on the performance criteria appropriate for the functional use of the \r space. There are five properties of ceramic tile to consider: coefficient of friction, durability classification or \r Porcelain Enamel Institute (PEI), scratch hardness, breaking strength, and water absorption. \r \r Select tiles with the following properties: \r \r � \r Coefficient of Friction: Floor tile must have a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) or \r higher in accordance with ASTM C-1028. Standing water and other contaminants create slippery \r conditions for any hard surface floor material. Floor applications with exposure to these conditions \r require extra caution in the tile selection. Use abrasive grains or raised textured tile for greater \r traction in areas with the possibility of standing water or grease build up. \r � \r Durability Classification: Floor tile must be Class IV�Heavy Traffic, durability classification as rated \r by the manufacturer when tested in accordance with ASTM C-1027 for abrasion resistance as related \r to foot traffic. Class III can be considered for residential installations. \r 04 � \r Scratch Hardness: Glazed floor tile must have a scratch hardness of 6.0 or higher. Do not use \r glazed tile in areas of high abuse where possible tile breakage may occur. Avoid high gloss or \r polished tiles for areas with high traffic; use only as accents in floor patterns. \r � \r Breaking Strength: Tile must be impact-resistant with a minimum breaking strength of 250 pounds in \r accordance with ASTM C-648. \r � \r Water Absorption: Use only vitreous or impervious tile for most applications in accordance with \r ASTM C-373. \r Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The \r pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile. \r Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts. \r \r � \r Slip Resistance: This is a major factor in the selection of tiles for kitchens and entrance lobbies. \r There are numerous products that have slip-resisting features for lobbies. Unglazed quarry tile works \r best for commercial kitchen floor installations. Because of the possibility of water and grease spillage, \r unglazed tile must be sealed in kitchens. \r � \r Color: Recommend tile with through-color, that is, color the entire thickness of the tile body. Avoid \r solid color tiles unless designed into a pattern. Avoid light-colored quarry tile in commercial kitchens. \r Colors and patterns must be approved by the Government. \r � \r Texture: Tiles with a textured surface and an interesting variation of colors will tend to show less \r surface soiling. \r � \r Grout: Select medium to dark pigmented grouts. Light grouts tend to change color and trap soil over \r time. Minimize the visibility of grout by using larger-sized tile. \r � \r Base: Use a matching tile base in commercial kitchens and other areas subject to excessive water. In \r other locations, wood or vinyl base may be appropriate. Ensure that there is an aesthetical transition \r If possible, use a dark tone grout, which coordinates with the floor tile to avoid a stained or soiled \r appearance. \r \r","keywords":[{"text":"tile work","relevance":0.824921},{"text":"functional use of the \r space","relevance":0.701787},{"text":"members of the Tile Council of North America","relevance":0.670875},{"text":"high-traffic areas","relevance":0.636914},{"text":"lower absorption-level tiles","relevance":0.613144},{"text":"Coefficient of Friction","relevance":0.603751},{"text":"Scratch Hardness","relevance":0.58969},{"text":"durability of ceramic tile","relevance":0.585258},{"text":"floor tile","relevance":0.577437},{"text":"larger tiles","relevance":0.576912},{"text":"Scratch resistance of glazes","relevance":0.56271},{"text":"Mohs Hardness","relevance":0.561341},{"text":"grout lines","relevance":0.554979},{"text":"Select tile","relevance":0.551635},{"text":"Technical Criteria","relevance":0.546762},{"text":"break rooms","relevance":0.545269},{"text":"porous surfaces","relevance":0.543463},{"text":"greater resistance","relevance":0.536075},{"text":"Porcelain Enamel Institute","relevance":0.535139},{"text":"minimum coefficient of friction","relevance":0.534358},{"text":"functional areas","relevance":0.531573},{"text":"unsupported portion of the tile \r specimen","relevance":0.531426},{"text":"combination of colors","relevance":0.531371},{"text":"Class IV�Heavy Traffic","relevance":0.530656},{"text":"dining facilities","relevance":0.528755},{"text":"latest TCNA installation handbook","relevance":0.527599},{"text":"amount of force","relevance":0.526681},{"text":"color","relevance":0.523681},{"text":"water absorption","relevance":0.522688},{"text":"major factor","relevance":0.522646}],"concepts":[{"text":"Grout","relevance":0.971564},{"text":"Hardness","relevance":0.968889},{"text":"Mohs scale of mineral hardness","relevance":0.949273},{"text":"Materials science","relevance":0.865896},{"text":"Tile","relevance":0.802649},{"text":"Building materials","relevance":0.703747},{"text":"Mineral","relevance":0.588319},{"text":"Standard","relevance":0.580889},{"text":"Ceramic glaze","relevance":0.551566},{"text":"Diamond","relevance":0.529139},{"text":"Floors","relevance":0.511984},{"text":"Talc","relevance":0.497071},{"text":"United States customary units","relevance":0.467372},{"text":"Friction","relevance":0.46051}]},{"_id":"5db224fec4cc5d17f29222bb","type":"subcategory","csi":"11 30 13","l1":"11","l2":"30","l3":"13","title":"Residential Appliances \r","body":"\r Appliances will be Government Furnished and Contractor Installed.

Design Teams must follow the criteria below in the identification of qualifying \r components for inclusion in final full design specifications and project drawings. Designers must \r communicate these requirements as well as requirements to track material and product data to project \r contractors. This section enables projects to exceed the minimum requirements set forth in various \r Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) that include sustainable and resilient product attributes, including those \r from UFC 1-200-02. \r \r All Projects \r \r All project types must develop a Material and Product Plan. The Material and Product Plan must be \r developed by the Design Team and communicated to the construction team, who will be responsible for \r implementation. The Design Team must identify a pool of qualifying materials and products so as not to \r sole source and violate Federal project procurement regulations. The Material and Product Plan must \r contain tracking mechanisms developed by the Design Team as appropriate to each project. The \r mechanisms must be provided to the contractor for use throughout construction. At project completion, \r \r 04 tracking information�including supporting vendor/manufacturer product information�must be \r provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. \r \r Reduce Net Embodied Carbon \r \r Project teams must strive to reduce embodied carbon associated with each project type; plans for \r implementation must be included in the Material and Product Plan. This approach combines concepts of \r sourcing local materials, using materials more efficiently, and using lower-impact materials in order to \r reduce the combined environmental impacts of material use. In the required calculations, carbon is used \r as a proxy unit of measure to compare various impacts across the entire supply chain of material \r consumption. One stage of this supply chain involves raw material extraction/harvesting, refinement, and \r manufacturing into products. The second involves transportation of the materials from the manufacturer to \r their final destination onsite. By designing projects to use less material, use material efficiently, or \r specifying materials with lower embodied carbon, as well as reducing transportation distances, project \r teams can reduce the overall impact of the project. \r \r Availability of data on the carbon intensity of materials is often limited, and some projects may involve \r hundreds or thousands of products. Therefore, acceptable documentation may take a streamlined \r approach for conducting calculations for this requirement. Project teams may identify a select list of \r primary materials/products that collectively make up greater than 80% of the total embodied carbon. If \r data on embodied carbon or material intensity is not available from the manufacturer, project teams may \r use averages or generalized data from studies or material databases. Project teams should track, \r document, and clearly explain their methodology for calculating material intensity. The resulting narrative \r must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record. \r \r Transportation of materials to project sites can be a significant contributor to the embodied carbon of \r materials. Local or regional materials�even materials sourced or processed onsite�reduce the impact of \r long transport and support local economies. It is important to note that while it is generally desirable to \r use locally sourced materials for the aforementioned reasons, use of local materials could have negative \r impacts on performance if those materials result in reduced durability, safety, or service life. Carbon \r emissions associated with the transportation of materials to the project site are specifically broken out as \r they are often simpler to calculate based on distance; quantity; and standard truck, air, rail, or shipping \r fuel consumption. Carbon emissions are also calculated separately to show the possible conflicts that \r exist of sourcing a lower-intensity material from farther away. Project teams should consider choices that \r reduce the overall net embodied carbon of materials. \r \r Documentation must include the following: \r \r � \r Determination of materials that are the primary contributors to embodied carbon for the project during \r construction and operation. \r � Documentation of the primary materials to be used in the construction and ongoing operation of \r the project over its life. Documentation should include: \r � \r The materials used. \r � \r General estimates of the quantities of materials used. \r Note that operations materials may need to be multiplied by the frequency of use over the \r project life. Material estimates should include anticipated repairs/upkeep (for example, road \r resurfacing). \r � \r Estimates of the embodied carbon of materials. \r Estimates may use readily available public information such as regional, national, or global \r averages. \r � Identification of the select materials that collectively will make up more than 80% of the total \r estimated embodied carbon of the project. \r � \r Calculations of the primary contributors to overall embodied carbon and an index of the embodied \r carbon calculations of the primary contributors to carbon intensity over the life of the project \r (construction and operations). This should include: \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r � Carbon emissions to produce the material, including raw material extraction, refinement, and \r manufacture including secondary or tertiary processing. \r � Carbon emissions from transporting the material from the manufacturer to the project site, \r including intermediary points. \r � Embodied carbon data may come from the manufacturer, reputable databases, reputable \r embodied energy software, or from project team calculations. If the source or specific type of \r materials is not known at the time of assessment, calculations may present a range of values or \r rely on likely material choices. Calculations should be in tons carbon dioxide (CO2). \r � \r Narrative explaining the project�s reduction of the net embodied carbon of materials used in \r construction and operation. \r � Documentation that the project has set targets for reducing net embodied carbon. \r � Documentation of strategies/plans to reduce net embodied carbon. These may include, but are \r not limited to: \r � \r Sizing the project to require less material. \r � \r Designing the project to use less material. \r � \r Choosing materials that have lower embodied carbon. \r � \r Reducing material needed for repair and maintenance. \r � \r Reducing material waste during construction. \r � \r Reducing material waste during operation. \r � \r Sourcing local materials to reduce transportation emissions. \r � \r Using lower-carbon transportation modes. \r � Calculations of reductions in embodied carbon achieved. Calculations should compare total \r carbon intensity of materials for the project against the total carbon intensity of the baseline. \r Calculations should be in tons CO2. \r Horizontal Projects \r \r Use Recycled Materials \r \r Using recycled, reused, and renewable materials and products�including existing structures and \r materials onsite�reduces demand for virgin materials and the embodied carbon emissions and \r environmental degradation attributed to their extraction and processing. Using these materials also \r reduces waste and supports the market for recycled and reused materials. Horizontal projects must use a \r minimum of 40% (by weight, volume, or cost) of recycled materials including materials with recycled \r content and/or reused existing structures or materials per individual project scope. Projects that lack \r applicable scope to meet this requirement must provide a narrative indicating justification to their \r Tyndall AFB project manager for consideration. Include descriptive narrative and tracking mechanisms in \r the Material and Product Plan. \r \r Suggested Strategies \r \r Reduce the amount of new pavement materials needed through soil stabilization methods to reduce the \r required thickness of a new pavement or processes that incorporate existing pavement structures into \r new pavement structures. The area treated is calculated based on the entire area of existing preserved or \r reconstructed pavement materials. \r \r Soil stabilization methods may include the use of geosynthetics (geogrids and fabrics) to reduce the \r thickness of aggregate required for stabilization of subgrade; the use of geosynthetics to reduce the \r thickness of aggregate above the geosynthetics that would have been required for structural support \r when subgrade soils are susceptible to pumping and base course intrusion; the use of Portland cement \r and/or cementitious by-product materials for soil stabilization for pavement construction, if it can be \r demonstrated that this process will reduce the use of natural aggregate (virgin aggregate or material \r hauled from off-site source) use for stabilization; other chemical stabilization; and fractured slab \r techniques, including crack-and-seat, and rubblization. \r \r 04 recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) or recycled concrete aggregate (RAP or RCA) in new pavement \r lifts or granular base course or embankments. The recycled materials can originate from the project or \r other areas at Tyndall AFB or surrounding areas, and be recycled onsite or offsite. \r \r Average recycled content (ARC) must be calculated per the following calculation: \r \r Where: \r ARC \r (%) \r = \r (S \r rn \r / \r S \r Wn) \r x \r 100% \r \r \r � rn = the total weight or volume of RAP or RCA \r � Wn = the total weight or volume of either all existing pavement materials or all bedding, backfill, \r and granular embankment materials per the method of recycling used \r � n = the number of materials considered in accordance with the method used \r Recycle pavement materials in place using cold-in-place recycling, hot-in-place recycling, and full depth \r reclamation methods. \r \r Reuse the subbase granular material of existing pavement elements as subgrade embankment or as part \r of the new subbase during construction of the proposed new pavement structure. \r \r Relocate and reuse at least 90% of the minor structural elements that meet current code, including \r existing luminaires, signal poles, and sign structures required to be removed and/or relocated onsite or by \r the agency. \r \r Calculations of recycled materials can be done by weight, volume, or cost, but must remain consistent \r throughout the project. Calculations should compare the total quantity of recycled materials and reused \r structures with the total quantity of materials on the project. Products that contain a percentage of \r recycled material should be factored according to the percentage of material that is recycled. \r \r Recycled content is defined in accordance with ISO 14021 as the portion of materials used in a product \r that have been diverted from the solid waste stream and used in part or whole in place of a new primary \r material. Material eligible for consideration can also be defined as pre-existing material onsite, or from \r another site, that was previously a product or piece of equipment that is now being repurposed or reused. \r \r To track contributing materials and efforts, project teams must coordinate between designers and \r contractors to generate the following documentation for submission to the Tyndall AFB project manager: \r \r � \r Total quantity of materials used on the project by weight, volume, or cost. \r � \r Inventory of specifications for materials containing recycled content. Inventory should include the \r name of the product, the name of the manufacturer, the weight, volume, or cost of the material, and \r the percentage of recycled content (either post-industrial or post-consumer recycled content). \r � \r Calculations of percentage of reused or recycled materials by weight, volume, or cost. To calculate \r materials with recycled content, multiply the material weight, volume, or cost by the percentage of \r recycled content. Mechanical, electrical, water equipment, and their components may be excluded \r from the calculations. In these instances, the most efficient equipment should be specified. \r Calculations do not include plants, soils, rocks, or water. \r � \r Inventory of existing materials or structures that have been reused. Design documents showing the \r location and weight, volume, or cost of reused structures or materials. In determining weight, volume, \r or cost, the project team may refer to standard equivalents. The project team must be able to \r demonstrate an intentional choice to salvage materials or structures that might otherwise have been \r sent to landfills and/or replaced. Provide a narrative to accompany the above required calculations. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r Material Content, Product Transparency, Responsible Sourcing, and Reuse Potential: Applicable \r to Divisions 3-10, 12, 21, 31-32 \r \r The requirements below specific to these topics enable vertical projects to exceed material and product \r selection criteria listed in UFC 1-200-02 and others.

These criteria exceed the requirements of the \r following sections in the Pre-Final IFS: \r \r � \r B.02.3 \r � \r C01.1 \r � \r C04.1 \r � \r C06.1.4 \r � \r D.02 \r � \r D03.2 \r � \r E.01 \r \r Project Certification \r \r A standard requirement of all DoD building projects is to comply with UFC 1-200-02, High Performance \r and Sustainable Building (HPSB) Requirements for Building Design and Construction. Similarly, \r UFC 3-201-01 and UFC 3-210-10 address the horizontal project aspects of vegetation design and \r stormwater control; these criteria collectively contribute to projects� required adherence with the Guiding \r Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings. All qualifying USAF projects that meet the thresholds for \r required third-party certification as explained in UFC 1-200-02 are additionally required to pursue Guiding \r Principles certification through either the Green Building Initiative or the Green Business Certification Inc. \r programs. The requirements contained within this appendix do not interfere with a project�s ability to meet \r the minimum requirements of either the UFC or the third-party certification program; rather, the guidelines \r enhance projects� resiliency and sustainability from a holistic approach and exceed nearly every minimum \r requirement for typical DoD projects. \r \r Within this section are requirements that apply to overall project design and do not necessarily lend \r themselves well to incorporation in individual Divisions. They represent holistic approaches rather than \r individual design components. Designers will see some specific mentions within other Divisions, however, \r when specific design features may be required that merit more detailed description in context of other \r products and materials. \r \r Integrative Process (Exceeds UFC 1-200-02) \r \r Integrative Process is a requirement of the Guiding Principles for vertical projects; this Tyndall AFB-\r specific Appendix, however, requires the design strategy for all project types. \r \r 04 the Integrative Process (IP) ANSI Consensus National Standard Guide� 2.0 for Design and \r Construction of Sustainable Buildings and Communities, which provides step-by-step guidance and a \r methodology for improving building design, construction, and operations through a replicable, integrative \r process. Also review ASHRAE 189.1 Informative Appendix F (Integrated Design) in accordance with the \r requirements of UFC 1-200-02. \r \r Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to \r achieve synergies across disciplines and building systems. Use the analyses described below to inform \r the OPR, BOD, design documents, and construction documents. \r \r � \r Form a diverse team of qualified professionals as early as possible. \r � Team members must coordinate with one another throughout the life of the project. For optimal \r interaction and communication, ensure the project team has multiple face-to-face meetings. \r � The integrative Design Team should include, at minimum, the following roles: \r � \r Owner and/or client \r � \r Professionals knowledgeable in design, construction, and maintenance \r � \r Professionals knowledgeable in sustainable and resilient practices \r � \r Professionals with expertise in vegetation, water, soils, landscape ecology, materials, and \r human health and well-being, selected to meet the unique constraints and opportunities of \r the project and its site \r � Identify project stakeholders and full range of potential site user groups and list the primary and \r secondary user groups \r � All members of the project team must provide the following documentation: \r � \r Name of each team member and his or her expertise (for example, vegetation, hydrology, \r soil, landscape ecology, materials, and human health) \r � \r Role on the project \r � \r If an individual fulfills more than one role on the project, explain how he or she has the \r various skill sets or expertise for each \r � \r Develop a collaborative communication process: \r � Develop an agreed-upon communication method for team members, which should be \r collaborative and allow the viewpoints and perspectives of all members to be fully considered in \r the decision-making process \r � Designate a team facilitator to be responsible for overseeing and ensuring a collaborative \r communication process \r � Develop a narrative describing the collaborative communication process: \r � \r List of team members responsible for facilitating collaborative communication \r � \r Signatures from all team members who participated in the collaborative communication \r process \r � \r Attach meeting minutes from all team meetings \r � \r Identify project S+R principles and performance goals: \r � Identify the principles and performance goals of the project (both short-and long-term) and \r include an associated timeline and specific performance measures for each goal to determine \r when it has been achieved \r � Designate specific team members to track project goals throughout the development process: \r � \r Identify project stakeholders \r � \r Identify the full range of potential site users; list the primary and secondary user groups \r � \r Incorporate the S+R principles and performance goals into a program: \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r � Develop a program plan that at minimum includes the following information: \r � \r The unique characteristics, opportunities, and constraints of the site \r � \r General project parameters, such as the scope, budget, implementation schedule, purpose, \r and design intent of the project \r � \r A diagram or description of the intended function, arrangement, and relationship of desired \r features and their approximate dimensions \r � For all project types, perform a preliminary resiliency analysis before the completion of schematic \r design that identifies potential physical and procedural actions that can be taken by the project to \r prepare for and mitigate short-and long-term hazards to the building, occupants, physical \r property, and physical infrastructure. System diversity and redundancy should be considered and \r accounted for in the approach. There is preference for ecologically based resiliency approaches \r over a hardened infrastructure approach. Explore shock-resistant planning and design for \r extreme weather events/heat waves along with ongoing adaptation to increasing ambient \r temperatures, sea level rise and flood intensity, water security, energy security, transportation \r access, and local self-reliance. Planning and design interventions should result in complementary \r systems and technics that have low demands for and/or produce water and energy, while \r supporting biodiversity that offers stabilizing levels of redundancy/back-up, local/regional self-\r reliance and development capacity, and shock resistance and recovery potential. \r � \r The study must consider damage impacts within the immediate project boundary and \r relevant surrounding areas along with the disruption of essential services that may become \r unavailable including, but not limited to electricity, water, sewer, security and fire department \r services. Opportunities for cooperative action with surrounding facilities or base-wide \r systems must be identified as a means of mitigation. Those opportunities will vary depending \r on the project location. \r � \r Safe and resilient issues reflecting site, local, regional hazards and opportunities may \r include, but are not limited to: extreme weather and rain, flooding, storm surge, extreme wind, \r discordant behavior or physical conflict, and exposure to hazardous materials. \r � \r For all projects: \r o \r Identify opportunities for cooperative behavior, collaboration and coordination to improve \r resilience and provide the socio-economic means for problem-solving. \r o \r Identify technical opportunities that can be used to improve resilience and provide \r physical tools for problem-solving. \r � \r Document how the above analysis informed design and form decisions in the project�s OPR \r and BOD and the eventual design of the project. \r � For all project types, perform a preliminary water budget analysis before the completion of \r schematic design that explores how to reduce potable water loads in the building and/or on the \r site, and accomplish related S+R goals. Assess and estimate the project�s potential non-potable \r water supply sources and water demand volumes, including the following: \r � \r Indoor water demand: assess flow and flush fixture design case demand volumes. \r � \r Outdoor water demand: assess landscape irrigation design case demand volume. \r � \r Process water demand: assess kitchen, laundry, cooling tower, and other equipment \r demand volumes, as applicable. \r � \r Supply sources: assess all potential non-potable water supply source volumes, such as \r onsite rainwater and graywater, municipally supplied nonpotable water, and HVAC equipment \r condensate. \r � Document how the above analysis informed building and site design decisions in the project�s \r OPR and BOD. Demonstrate how at least one onsite non-potable water supply source was used \r to reduce the burden on municipal supply or wastewater treatment systems by contributing to at \r least two of the water demand components listed above. Demonstrate how the analysis informed \r the design of the project, including the following, as applicable: \r 04 � \r Plumbing systems \r � \r Sewage conveyance and/or onsite treatment systems \r � \r Rainwater quantity and quality management systems \r � \r Landscaping, irrigation, and site elements \r � \r Roofing systems and/or building form and geometry \r � \r Other systems \r � For buildings projects, perform a preliminary �simple box� energy modeling analysis before the \r completion of schematic design that explores how to reduce energy loads in the building and \r accomplish related S+R goals by questioning default assumptions. Assess at least two potential \r strategies associated with the following: \r � \r Site conditions: assess shading, exterior lighting, hardscape, landscaping, and adjacent site \r conditions \r � \r Massing and orientation: assess how massing and orientation affect HVAC sizing, energy \r consumption, lighting, and renewable energy opportunities \r � \r Basic envelope attributes: assess insulation values, window-to-wall ratios, glazing \r characteristics, shading, and window operability \r � \r Lighting levels: assess interior surface reflectance values and lighting levels in occupied \r spaces \r � \r Thermal comfort ranges: assess thermal comfort range options \r � \r Plug and process load needs: assess reducing plug and process loads through programmatic \r solutions (for example, equipment and purchasing policies, layout options) \r � \r Programmatic and operational parameters: assess multifunctioning spaces, operating \r schedules, space allotment per person, teleworking, reduction of building area, and \r anticipated O&M \r � Document how the above analysis informed design and building form decisions in the project�s \r OPR and BOD and the eventual design of the project, including the following, as applicable: \r � \r Building and site program \r � \r Building form and geometry \r � \r Building envelope and fa�ade treatments on different orientations \r � \r Elimination and/or significant downsizing of building systems (for example, HVAC, lighting, \r controls, exterior materials, interior finishes, and functional program elements) \r � \r Other systems \r � Describe how all other S+R principles and performance goals will be incorporated into the design. \r � Engage the client in participating in and ideally leading a design charrette process with the \r assistance of the project Design Team leadership. The Design Team should embrace a systems \r thinking design approach. Follow the steps of design optimization, as applicable, in \r ASHRAE 189.1 Section F1.1.1 (Charrette Process). Maintain all meeting minutes as attachments \r for process documentation. \r � \r Plan for construction oversight: \r � Designate a team member, other than the contractor, who will be responsible for verifying the site \r is built per the construction specifications and drawings. \r � Meet with the contractor prior to construction to review construction specifications, submittal \r requirements, and drawings and to convey the project�s principles and performance goals. \r � Describe the agreed upon method whereby changes can be made in the field during construction. \r � \r Develop a strategy for preparing a site or project maintenance plan as appropriate: \r � Include all team members in the development of the maintenance plan. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r � Discuss available resources (for example, budget, staff, volunteers, equipment, materials) as part \r of the maintenance plan. Determine short-and long-term maintenance principles and \r performance goals. \r � \r Compile all documentation required above as project record and submit in final electronic format to \r the Tyndall AFB project manager as part of the design closeout phase. \r General Design Requirements \r \r Accessible, Inclusive, Universal Design (Exceeds UFC 1-200-01) \r \r Universal design recognizes and encourages assets inclusive for all users regardless of age, size, ability, \r or disability to use an asset; it addresses multiple aspects of a built space, including infrastructure, \r signage, and technologies, and together seek to enhance the opportunity for all individuals to exist \r independently and comfortably in a space. Due to variations in legislation and design practices for \r accessibility, usability, and inclusivity, the project criterion herein does not stipulate extensive, specific \r design requirements, dimensions, or number of each type of feature within the asset. This criterion does, \r however, list strategies that Design Teams must consider for integration in order to constitute a \r reasonable level of provision and design of features for the type, size, and number of users of any \r particular asset. \r \r All projects must refer to the following best practice guidance as applicable to each project type: \r \r � \r ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction: Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment \r � \r BS 8300-1:2018, Design of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment, Part 1: External \r Environment: Code of Practice \r � \r BS 8300-2:2018, Design of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment, Part 2: Buildings: Code of \r Practice \r � \r Draft prEN 17210, Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, Functional Requirements \r � \r Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach, Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, 2012 \r (http://universaldesign.ie/Built-Environment/Building-for-Everyone/) \r The following features must be integrated to the maximum extent possible as appropriate to each project \r type after projects have met required minimum project criteria: \r \r � \r Accessibility features related to access: \r � Step-free external access (that is, level, gentle slope, or ramp) from the site boundary to the main \r entrance(s) or alternative accessible entrance of the asset. \r � Handrails to external stepped and ramped access routes to the main entrance(s) or alternative \r accessible entrance of the asset. \r � Where car parking is provided for the asset and asset users include parents with young children, \r designated parking spaces for motorists accompanied by a child in a stroller \r � \r Accessibility features related to horizontal and vertical circulation: \r � Accessible horizontal and vertical emergency evacuation routes (such as in the event of fire) and \r facilities (such as evacuation chairs) or a strategy and plan for assisted evacuation. \r � Include resting areas with seating at various heights, including seating with back rests and \r without arm rests \r � Provide accessible routes 43 inches in width, at minimum \r � Install drinking fountains, assistance animal areas, and bike racks that are easily accessed from \r all sides \r � Include detectable warnings (such as truncated domes) at official pedestrian crossings that \r intersect with vehicular paths \r 04 � Design the site with open sight lines to and from entries \r � \r Accessibility features related to the use of a facility: \r � Power-operated entrance door(s) (such as via push pad or motion sensor). \r � Door and drawer hardware that requires no grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. \r � Install 36-inch wide doors, at minimum, in all occupied spaces \r � Provide circulation paths 20% wider than required, at minimum \r � Increase clear floor space at appliances and fixtures to 30 by 52 inches, at minimum \r � Increase the size of turning space to 72 inches in diameter, at minimum \r � \r Accessibility features related to sanitary accommodation: \r � Restroom(s) with an assistance alarm accessible by those who use wheelchairs, at least one of \r which is a gender-neutral facility. \r � Where asset users include parents with young children, baby changing facilities as well as baby \r strap-in chairs accessible for all parents regardless of gender. Include family restrooms. \r � Where showers, bathrooms, or changing rooms are provided for asset users, accessible versions \r to accommodate persons who use wheelchairs, persons with limited mobility, and similar. \r � \r Orientation and wayfinding: \r � Well-planned layouts that clearly identify key elements such as entrances, reception areas, \r sanitary facilities, and similar. \r � Good lighting conditions with additional illumination at decision points such as access routes, \r entrances, staircases, and elevators. \r � Clear information and legible and easily understood signage, including availability in different \r languages where appropriate to the asset location. \r � Use of visual contrast and color to facilitate orientation and navigation, to provide warnings about \r potential hazards, and to facilitate reading of information and signs. \r � Provision of tactile information, for example, embossed signage, Braille signage, tactile walking \r surface indicators, tactile maps, models and plans, changes in floor surface, changes in level, \r tapping rails. \r � Audible communication and sounds, for example, talking signs, announcement systems, audio \r descriptive way-finding information, changes in walking surface. \r � \r Assistive technologies: \r � Hearing enhancement system(s) (such as induction loop) at service or reception counters and in \r rooms and spaces used for meetings, lectures, classes, performances, spectator sport or films. \r � Audible information systems. \r � Visual alarm systems. \r � Height adjustable desks, adjustable height counters (with fixtures, where applicable), and \r accessible height sales and service counters. \r � Voice or touch screen operated controls for devices and systems affecting occupancy of the \r space and user comfort, including but not limited to, lighting, window shades, and thermostats. \r Through thoughtful incorporation of accessible and universal design, projects can establish an inclusive \r and enabling community where people of all abilities can effectively and easily access, use, and engage \r with a space. \r \r Adaptability and Flexible Design of Buildings \r \r Flexible design is a priority in military facilities, as mission priorities can shift and require different \r functionality needs. Having adaptable major building elements increases project space flexibility, ease of \r \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r , and recycling of building materials while considering differential durability and premature \r obsolescence over building design life and individual component service lives. \r \r All vertical projects must produce a project-specific Functional Adaptation Study in early design phases, \r prior to the completion of concept development. The study must explore design strategies that could be \r used to ensure longevity of the building past initial intended use and occupancy type. Renovation projects \r must incorporate strategies as applicable to the existing site or building constraints. \r \r The functional adaptation strategy study must include exploration of the following: \r \r � \r Feasibility: The likelihood to contain multiple or alternative building uses, area functions and different \r tenancies over the expected life cycle, for example, related to the structural design of the building. \r � \r Accessibility: Design aspects that facilitate the replacement of all major components within the life of \r the building, for example, panels in floors and walls that can be removed without affecting the \r structure, providing lifting beams and hoists. Accessibility also involves access to local services, such \r as local power, data infrastructure, and similar. \r � \r Versatility: The degree of adaptability of the internal environment to accommodate changes in \r working practices. \r � \r Adaptability: The potential of the building ventilation strategy to adapt to future building occupant \r needs and climatic scenarios. \r � \r Convertibility: The degree of adaptability of the internal physical space and external shell to \r accommodate changes in use. \r � \r Expandability: The potential for the building to be extended, horizontally, or vertically. \r � \r Refurbishment Potential: The potential for major refurbishment, including replacing the fa�ade. \r Project design must then be informed via the study results and must implement the strategies below to \r the maximum extent possible. New construction projects must include a minimum of six of the following \r flexible design strategies; renovation projects must include a minimum of three: \r \r � \r A flexible internal vertical loadbearing structure design with a regular column layout and few or no \r loadbearing walls. \r � \r Floor plan shapes, primary circulation routes, and floor-to-floor heights suitable for several potential \r future uses. \r � \r Use interstitial space. Design distribution zone utility systems and equipment (including HVAC, \r plumbing, electrical, information technology, and life safety systems) to serve the occupied zones and \r have the capacity to control multiple zones in both occupied and unoccupied spaces. \r � \r Implement flexible power distribution (that is, plug-and-play) systems for at least 50% of the project \r floor area so lighting, data, voice, and other systems can be easily reconfigured and repurposed. \r � \r Implement a flexible lighting control system with plug-and-play components such as wall controls, \r sensors, and dimming ballasts for a minimum of 50% of the lighting load. The system must allow for \r reconfiguring and repurposing of luminaires and controls without rewiring (such as having the \r capability to group and assign luminaires into zones and change those zones as needed). Also, the \r system must be flexible so that as a space changes functions, the lighting levels can change to suit \r the needs of the space without rewiring or removing or adding luminaires. \r � \r Identify horizontal expansion capacity equal to at least 30% of existing floor area without demolition of \r occupied space (other than at the connection point). \r � \r Design for future vertical expansion on at least 75% of the roof, ensuring that existing operations and \r service systems can continue at or near capacity during the expansion. \r � \r Design at least 50% of interior nonstructural walls, ceilings, and floors to be movable or demountable. \r 04 � \r Use movable or modular casework for at least 50% of casework and custom millwork. Base the \r calculation on the combined value of casework and millwork, as determined by the cost estimator or \r contractor. \r � \r Include in at least one major component or systems purchase contract a clause specifying subcontractor, \r vendor, or onsite take back system. To meet the criteria for a take-back or leasing \r program, the arrangement must cover a �major system or component,� defined as any product or \r group of items used in the majority (more than 50%) of the project spaces where that item is relevant. \r Examples of qualifying systems include ceilings, carpeting, furniture, partitions, and casework. An \r example that may not qualify is built-in casework, which is typically not installed in more than half of a \r project�s spaces. \r � \r Include integral labels. Reuse and recycling extend the use of materials, but during deconstruction it \r can be difficult to identify reusable and recyclable products. Specifying products with integral labels \r (radio frequency identification, engraving, embossing, or other permanent marking) containing \r information on material origin, properties, and date of manufacture will allow easier identification and \r reuse of these materials in the future. Refer to the CSA Z782-06 Guideline for Design for \r Disassembly and Adaptability in Buildings for further information on integral labeling. \r � \r Leverage leasing arrangements.

Substances might include \r cleaning supplies, laboratory chemicals, or materials required for vehicular maintenance. \r � \r Monitors must measure the following within a regularly occupied or common space in the \r building, as appropriate by building and activity type: \r o \r Particulate matter (accuracy 2 micrograms per cubic meter [�g/m�] + 15% of reading at \r values \r between 0 and 150 �g/m�) \r o \r CO2 (accuracy 50 ppm + 3% of reading at values between 400 and 2,000 ppm) \r o \r Carbon monoxide (accuracy 1 ppm at values between 0 and 10 ppm) \r o \r Ozone (accuracy 10 parts per billion [ppb] at values between 0 and 100 ppb) \r o \r Nitrogen dioxide (accuracy 20 ppb at values between 0 and 100 ppb) \r o \r Total VOCs \r (accuracy \r 20 �g/m� \r + \r 20% \r of \r reading at \r values \r between 150 and 2,000 ppm) \r o \r Formaldehyde (accuracy 20 ppb at values between 0 and 100 ppb) \r � \r Monitor density is minimum one per floor or one every 3,500 feet, whichever is more \r stringent. Monitors are sited at locations compliant with the following requirements: \r o \r 3 to 6 feet above the finished floor at locations where occupants would typically be \r seated or standing. \r o \r Sampling points must be at least 3.3 feet away from doors, windows, and air supply or \r exhaust outlets. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r are taken at intervals of no longer than 10 minutes for particulate matter \r and CO2 and no longer than 1 hour for other pollutants. \r � Typically, apparatus bays in fire stations or similar facilities are not designed for human \r occupancy and would not be required to meet the above requirements. If these spaces will \r be occupied, however, they must be ventilated according to the applicable reference \r standard above. \r � Vehicle repair facilities and maintenance bay-space types include military buildings where trucks, \r tanks, aircraft, and other vehicles are being serviced. Because these are occupied spaces, they \r must meet the above requirements. \r � For healthcare facilities, determine the minimum outdoor air intake flow for mechanical ventilation \r systems using the ventilation rates in ASHRAE 170, Ventilation of Health Care Facilities (with \r errata), or the requirements of the Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) Guidelines for Design and \r Construction of Health Care Facilities. For any area not covered in ASHRAE 170 or the FGI \r guidelines, follow ASHRAE 62.1 or a local equivalent, whichever is more stringent and meets the \r minimum requirements of ASHRAE 170. \r � For commercial kitchen spaces, makeup air velocity near (or directed at) the hood is less than \r 75 fpm, replacement air introduced directly into the exhaust hood cavity does not exceed 10% of \r the hood exhaust airflow rate, and at least 50% of the air that replaces the exhaust air is \r conditioned transfer air rather than makeup air. \r � \r Systems must be designed to incorporate thermal comfort: \r � Spaces must be designed to accommodate 98% of the standard occupied hours of the year, 95% \r of regularly occupied spaces achieve thermal conditions representing Predicted Mean Vote levels \r within �0.5; Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied =10% (per ASHRAE 55). \r � For commercial kitchen spaces, the operative temperature in the kitchen does not exceed 80�F at \r any time. \r � For residential units, all regularly occupied spaces must have the flexibility to accommodate the \r installation of cooling device(s) that allow tenants to maintain desirable comfort conditions in \r bedrooms and living spaces. \r � \r Provide separate mechanical, electrical, and communications rooms. \r � \r Avoid placing HVAC units and any other mechanical equipment on top of roofs (that is, no \r penetrations through roofs) due to problems with roof leaks, accessibility, and maintainability \r requirements. If rooftop equipment is necessary, use existing roof warranty holder to perform the \r work, if applicable. Indoor equipment is preferred. Mechanical equipment rooms must: \r � Be provided with a floor drain or floor sink, which must have a trap guard or trap primer \r � Be located along exterior walls with exterior access doors \r � Be provide with location for temporary cooling equipment tie-in \r � Be provided with domestic water with hose bib and 115V power outlets \r � Include space for all plumbing equipment \r � \r All mechanical equipment must be mounted on 6-inch housekeeping pads with vibration isolators to \r prevent the transmission of vibration and mechanically transmitted sound to the building structure. \r � \r Provide beams and/or overhead attachment points as appropriate to facilitate large motor and other \r heavy equipment replacement. \r � \r Outdoor equipment placement must: \r � Be elevated above the flood plain \r � Consider solar effects on operating conditions (south building orientation, shading from \r equipment yard walls, and similar). All outdoor equipment materials must be UV stabilized. \r � Avoid roof-mounted equipment when possible. Use ridgeline vents or gable vents instead of \r roof-mounted rotating fan vents. When roof-mounted equipment is used, equipment must be \r 04 with appropriate supports rated for wind risk category and must be coordinated with a \r structural engineer. \r \r � Equipment yards must: \r � \r Comply with all architectural, safety, and resiliency requirements \r � \r Have either concrete or permeable gravel \r � \r Be provided with a means for drainage \r � \r Be provided with a hose bib \r � \r Be provided with safety showers when appropriate for chemicals present \r � \r Be covered by security cameras and integrated into EMCS and operation centers \r � \r Be provided with convenience receptacles \r � \r Provide prevention and control measures to reduce potential risk from legionella bacteria. These may \r include, but are not limited to: \r � Avoiding water temperatures between 68�F and 113�F and conditions that favor the growth of \r legionella bacteria and other microorganisms \r � Avoiding water stagnation that may encourage the growth of biofilm \r � Avoiding the use of materials that harbor bacteria and other microorganisms or provide nutrients \r for microbial growth \r � Controlling the release of water spray \r � Maintaining the cleanliness of the system and water in it \r � Using water treatment techniques such as biocides, chlorination, and heat \r","keywords":[{"text":"residential units","relevance":0.663996},{"text":"use of central cooling plants","relevance":0.63284},{"text":"system equipment","relevance":0.614792},{"text":"ASHRAE \r design temperatures","relevance":0.60865},{"text":"salt-laden air","relevance":0.603901},{"text":"carbon monoxide monitors","relevance":0.59617},{"text":"positive ventilation","relevance":0.590879},{"text":"Natural ventilation","relevance":0.587908},{"text":"Tyndall AFB","relevance":0.587856},{"text":"outdoor enclosures","relevance":0.571932},{"text":"Use values","relevance":0.559189},{"text":"exhaust air","relevance":0.557599},{"text":"crawl spaces","relevance":0.556711},{"text":"Pre-treat ventilation air","relevance":0.554858},{"text":"outdoor air systems","relevance":0.552974},{"text":"similar facilities","relevance":0.552569},{"text":"top of roofs","relevance":0.545935},{"text":"design performance","relevance":0.545838},{"text":"0.05-inch \r water gauge","relevance":0.543851},{"text":"Incorporate airflow","relevance":0.543034},{"text":"Rental equipment","relevance":0.54255},{"text":"adjacent buildings","relevance":0.538746},{"text":"square foot","relevance":0.536884},{"text":"HVAC system design","relevance":0.534263},{"text":"Use ridgeline vents","relevance":0.533734},{"text":"degradation of materials","relevance":0.532516},{"text":"healthcare facilities","relevance":0.531073},{"text":"water sources","relevance":0.529611},{"text":"Tyndall AFB-specific utility rates","relevance":0.529416},{"text":"stainless steel","relevance":0.528671}],"concepts":[{"text":"HVAC","relevance":0.969597},{"text":"Indoor air quality","relevance":0.560684},{"text":"Air pollution","relevance":0.417269},{"text":"Tool","relevance":0.411746},{"text":"Infiltration","relevance":0.411697},{"text":"Mechanical engineering","relevance":0.379735},{"text":"Thermal comfort","relevance":0.354808},{"text":"Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning","relevance":0.349575},{"text":"Parts-per notation","relevance":0.347047}]},{"_id":"5db22506c4cc5d17f292230b","type":"subcategory","csi":"25 51 00","l1":"25","l2":"51","l3":"00","title":"Integrated Automation Control of Facility Equipment \r","body":"\r All microprocessor-based HVAC equipment (5 tons and greater) and plumbing equipment capable of \r BACnet integration must be integrated into the EMCS.

The operational \r team needs to be completely trained for all building systems functionality at the component and system \r levels. It is critical to the mission of the base that a process for seamlessly transitioning capital projects \r from construction to full operational control is implemented. \r \r Assurances can be provided by integrating a whole building commissioning program into each new \r construction and renovation project. The program extends from planning/1391 development through \r activation and occupancy. The following represent sections describe key elements of the program. \r \r Planning and Design Phase \r \r � \r Develop OPR: Includes the overall goals of the project; quality standards; operational and warranty \r requirements; training expectations (BOD, equipment level, and system level); cost considerations; \r and measurable performance criteria. \r � \r Develop BOD: Describes how each element of the OPR will be implemented in the design. \r � \r Participate in Focused Design Review: Determines if there are systematic errors and to ensure \r that training and warranty requirements meet our expectations, not to fully check the design accuracy \r of the Design Team. \r � \r Develop Commissioning (Cx) Specification: Defines the administrative requirements of the \r Commissioning Process and the Commissioning Authority (CxA) involvement with the contractor and \r is typically included in the General Conditions. \r � \r Develop the Cx Plan: Describes responsibilities of the Commissioning Team members, schedule, \r and activities through each phase of the project delivery, documentation requirements, \r communication channels, and procedures for documenting and resolving situations when verification \r does not meet the Owner's Project Requirements. \r � \r Develop the Measurement and Verification (M&V) Plan: Defines the method for evaluating and \r tracking the building energy performance. \r 04 Phase \r \r � \r Cx Site Observation During Rough-in: During the construction phase, especially when building \r systems are being installed, it is important for key members of the commissioning team to have a \r regular onsite presence. \r � \r O&M Documentation Cx Review: The coordination of O&M documentation is often left to the end of \r the project and can have a negative impact on how the systems operate over the life of the building. \r Early review of these documents results in improved quality and useful tools. \r � \r Warranty Documentation Cx Review: Given the importance of proper system operation over the life \r of the buildings, ensuring that equipment warranties meet the O&M team�s requirements is of critical \r importance. \r � \r Enterprise Asset Management System (EAMS)/Computerized Maintenance ManagementSystem (CMMS) Integration: The commissioning process should verify that all assets are fully \r integrated into the EAMS/CMMS. This process includes: \r � Verify the asset tagging information to confirm that the EAMS/CMMS tag aligns with all other \r documentation associated with a particular asset. Ideally, the naming protocol is established early \r in the project so that it can be carried forward throughout the design and construction process. \r � Observe actual asset tag locations and content while onsite is beneficial to confirm consistency. \r � Ensue the maintenance practices incorporated in the EAMS/CMMS represent industry best \r practices for that particular asset and not just boilerplate O&M data. \r � Verify warranty information is properly captured in the EAMS/CMMS can prevent unintentional \r repairs on equipment that is under warranty. \r � \r Pre-Functional Testing: Pre-functional checklists (PFCs) are used to ensure the equipment and \r systems are installed and operational in accordance with the contract documents and that Functional \r Performance Testing (FPT) may proceed without unnecessary delays. The Cx team prepares the \r PFCs that address asset labeling, equipment delivery, installation, start-up, and building automation \r system configuration for all systems and equipment being commissioned. \r � \r Equipment Start-up: Is the first chance to observe the equipment in its operating condition and is an \r essential part of the Cx process. \r � \r Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing (TAB) Review: TAB is a critical element of the project delivery \r process. The CxA should work with construction team to coordinate their activities of the TAB \r contractor for each project. \r � \r Training Planning: As part of the training planning process, the training requirements should be \r reviewed against the expectations and requirements of the O&M team. \r Testing and Training \r \r � \r Attend Planning Meetings: The Cx team schedules, organizes, leads, and supervises the functional \r performance testing, with the involvement of the installing contractors to operate systems. \r � \r Functional Performance Testing: This is the dynamic testing of systems under full operation. \r � An FPT only commences when the pre-functional testing and checklists are complete and \r approved by the CxA and O&M team. \r � Systems are tested under various modes (such as during low loads, high loads, component \r failures, unoccupied, varying outdoor conditions, alarm conditions, and utility failures). The \r systems are run through all the Energy Management Control System (EMCS)sequences of \r operation and components are verified to be responding as intended. When systems do not pass \r a test, issues are clearly documented in an issues log. Items in the log are reviewed and closed \r through the issue resolution process. Systems are then re-tested. \r � The results of this phase establish the operational baseline for the systems and their \r components. The O&M team time commitment can be significant, particularly for a large project. \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r &M team participation during FPT is possibly the best method of introducing building systems to \r those responsible for operating them. Systems to be commissioned include: \r \r � \r Mechanical \r � \r Electrical \r � \r Plumbing \r � \r Life safety (Fire Protection and Fire Alarm System) \r � \r Energy Management and Control Systems \r � \r Building Envelope \r � \r Low voltage \r o \r Security \r o \r Mass notification \r o \r Distributed Antennae \r o \r Synchronized Clock System \r � \r Conveyance/vertical transportation \r � \r Integrated Systems Testing (IST): The building systems� interoperability is verified under a number \r of failure scenarios. In critical facilities, this is an industry standard best Cx practice. The primary test \r is when the normal power supply to the building is �turned off� and the team observes how the \r building systems respond. During this test, not only are generators, fuel systems, and transfer \r switching tested, but many other integrated systems are verified for performance under these \r conditions. While on normal power and emergency power, the team needs to verify that the EMCS, \r fire alarm, security, and other systems continue to operate as designed regardless of power source or \r power switching. It is common to find some systems do not perform correctly when switching to \r emergency power or back to normal power. The IST process is the first time the O&M team will be \r exposed to emergency management procedures related to the new facility and the lessons learned \r are extremely valuable. The results of this testing often drives institutional standard operating \r procedures (SOPs) and utility management plans. \r � \r Corrective Action: Corrective Issue Reports (CIRs) are generated by the CxA when issues or \r problems arise during the Cx process. The report will describe the problem condition along with any \r related reference information and issued to the construction team for corrective action. When the \r necessary corrections have been completed, the actions taken are documented and the item is \r closed in the issues log. Depending on the nature of the issue or problem, the CxA, along with the \r project stakeholders, will determine if re-testing of the equipment or system is necessary. It is \r important to have the O&M team engaged during the corrective issues process so the issue is clearly \r understood by all parties and everyone understands the resolution. \r � \r Owner Training: Training is one of the most important aspects of turning the project over to the O&M \r team. As-built documents, O&M manuals, and all approved submittals should be turned over to the \r O&M staff prior to any training. The delivery of close-out materials should be verified by the CxA. The \r training must include both component/equipment level and integrated system level sessions. All \r training sessions should follow the pre-approved agendas and plans, all attendees should sign the \r attendance sheet during the sessions, and a follow-up evaluation is performed to verify the trainees \r were provided with the pertinent information to properly operate and maintain the facility. All training \r materials should be captured and translated into a format, such as PowerPoint, that allows for new \r hire training as well as continuous training of current staff. Training sessions are only effective if \r attended by the appropriate personnel. At this point in the transition to operational control, there \r should be representation from each responsible shift attending the training sessions for each building \r system. This is another critical step in the delivery process. \r Post Construction \r \r � \r Finalize SOPs: One of the keys to achieving operational excellence is having clear, concise \r documentation on how the integrated building systems function as a whole. As part of the systems \r manual, SOPs for all potential conditions should be provided. These should be developed to allow for \r the documents to be laminated and placed on or near the primary system components and control \r points. In a �critical to mission� environment, being able to respond to an unplanned incident quickly \r and effectively can have a direct impact on mission readiness and being prepared for such an event \r is the best way to mitigate that risk. During the development of the standard operating procedures, \r 04 Cx/O&M team plays a vital role where they need to define their team composition and provide \r input to the level of detail desired for each system. \r \r � \r Seasonal/Deferred Testing: Despite all the efforts of the Cx team members to complete all \r verification testing prior to project close-out and occupancy, identify any systems that cannot be \r tested at this juncture because of project phasing and/or weather conditions. Any seasonal \r verification issues will be well documented and the appropriate Cx team members will need to be \r convened to carry out these tests. The need for O&M team involvement is crucial because the facility \r is now occupied and under their control. These tests will need to be closely coordinated to ensure \r occupant comfort and overall life safety is not impacted. \r � \r Warranty Item Review and Verification: Ideally, 10 months into the 12-month warranty period the \r team returns to meet with the specific O&M personnel. This process should include and be recorded \r in the Final Cx Report: \r � Review of O&M experience in operating various systems \r � Recommendations for improvement \r � Warranty claims registered during the first months of operation \r � Record documentation of any warranty items that require follow-up \r � Summary of O&M personnel recommendations for system performance enhancements \r � O&M staff requests for additional and/or supplementary training sessions \r � Suggestions for improvements in the Cx process to be implemented on future projects \r � \r M&V Implementation: To ensure that energy performance goals are achieved, incorporating \r measurement and verification elements into the project delivery process is essential. Even though the \r facilities will be brand new, the design phase began several years ago and there may be \r opportunities for further energy consumption savings. Throughout construction, the team may identify \r additional measures that should be considered for future savings. \r � M&V should be implemented during the warranty phase and after a full year of occupancy. \r � The energy performance of the facilities should be observed and the performance documented. \r Since full occupancy may be well beyond the initial warranty period, the operational team should \r review the performance after a full year of occupancy to verify that the true targeted goals are \r being achieved and to identify any additional measures that may be implemented. \r � \r Final EMCS Training: Final training on EMCS needs to occur within the first month of occupancy. \r Several training sessions prior to occupancy will help the O&M staff establish baseline knowledge. \r The final training will focus on system level operations within the occupied facility. \r � \r Long-term Training: A long-term training planning should address core competency requirements \r that align with the building systems in place. With an ongoing training plan in place, the O&M team \r will be able to operate the facilities safely, efficiently, and effectively under all operating conditions. \r � \r Develop Monitoring Based Cx Program: A continuous process to resolve operating issues, \r improve comfort, and optimize energy use. Using the successfully commissioned systems as the \r baseline, all the operating parameters and sequences of operation are recorded. Through the EMCS, \r �trigger� points are identified, and alarms are initiated when a system is performing out of its \r optimized range. These points can include efficiency rating (kilowatts per ton [kW/ton]), a setpoint \r (static pressure), or total runtime (hours) � individually or in a combination. Monthly reports should be \r generated that allow the O&M team to search for anomalies. This process verifies that the building \r and systems performance are optimized to meet the current operating requirements, which ultimately \r extends the useful life of an asset and reduces the operating costs. \r The following General Cx specification section describes the process and contractor requirements: \r \r PART 1 -GENERAL \r \r 1.1.

The purpose of the Cx Process is to provide the Owner with independent verification that the \r systems to be commissioned have been constructed according to the contract documents and \r operate within the performance guidelines set forth in the OPR, the BOD, the project construction \r drawings, and specifications. Commissioning consists of systematically documenting that \r specified components and systems have been installed and activated properly and then \r functionally tested to verify and document proper operation through all sequences of operation \r and conditions. In addition, training of the Owner�s O&M personnel will be verified, and final \r project O&M documents will be reviewed for completeness and to support the successful \r transition from construction phase to the occupancy and use phase. \r B. The commissioning process does not alleviate or reduce the responsibility of the design \r professionals, construction managers, or installing contractors to provide a complete and finished \r product, installed and fully functional in accordance with the contract documents. \r C. Commissioning is intended to enhance the quality of system start-up and aid in the orderly \r transfer of systems for use and maintenance by the Owner. Quality Cx requires participation by \r all parties involved with the project design and construction process, including the Owner, Design \r Team, construction managers and contractors, and the Owner�s Facilities Management. \r D. The Commissioning Authority will lead the Cx team, planning and coordinating all commissioning \r activities in conjunction with Cx team members. \r 04 .3. SYSTEMS TO BE COMMISSIONED \r A.

The zone must have native grasses, shrubs, and trees that are local to the \r environment and as recommended by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service recommendations for what is \r currently being used on the base in the natural areas. \r \r Transition Zone: The Transition Zone must contain mostly native wire and Indian grasses. It will be \r mowed only twice per year when recommend. \r \r Maintained Zone: This zone is located around the immediate perimeter of a building or the center of a \r main space , such as the town center. Areas in this zone will have turf grass that will be mowed on a \r regular basis to keep a manicured look. The zone should be drought resistant and also contain native \r trees for shade and ornamental grasses and native shrubs for color and variety. Ornamental grasses and \r shrubs should be located in areas close to building entrances. Design should be simple in nature but bold \r in color. All landscaping should be to maintain. \r \r Flight Line Zone: The Flight Line Zone is similar to the Maintained Zone except that tree use should be \r limited and not be planted close to the runway. Trees should be placed further back toward the second \r row of structures. Trees should be limited to species that do not attract birds. \r \r 04 October 2019 \r \r \f\r Principles \r \r Minimizing Water Requirements \r \r The base will have limited irrigation except in the Maintained Zone, which might receive water through a \r rainwater harvesting system. Use plant species that are native and drought-tolerant. Temporary irrigation \r may be used to establish plantings once they are first planted but not after one growing season. \r \r Plant Material Selection \r \r Plant selection must be as specified herein. Contractor/designer has the ability to modify the planting \r pallet as long as it is approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife representative on the base. It must be native \r and found in the local environment having shown resiliency to drought and establishment in native soils. \r \r Water Budgeting (Hydrozones) \r \r Streetscape Landscaping \r \r Street landscaping must be similar to the zone in which it is planted, most likely in the Transition Zone. \r Bioswales should use planting recommended by Florida Fish and Wildlife that is capable of living in \r varied conditions of short-term flooding to drought. Major streets should be lined with native trees to \r provide shade and direct traffic. Trees must be planted on the land side of sidewalks and not between \r sidewalks and curbs. \r \r Parking Lot Landscaping \r \r Parking lots should have native species of trees, shrubs, and grasses arranged in large groups to form a \r designed look instead of a native, organic look. For islands with drainage, plants should be able to \r withstand the same conditions specified for bioswales. Use trees for shade where appropriate. Do not \r plant trees in small island spaces; plant them in the outside perimeter of the parking lot or in islands that \r are no less than 10 feet wide. \r \r Screen/Accent Landscaping \r \r Plantings for screening shall must be native and evergreen of medium height. \r \r Drip Irrigation Zones (Special Irrigation) \r \r Drip irrigation will be used in shrub planting areas adjacent to building entrances where special planting \r occurs. The water should not be potable and should come from rainwater harvesting. \r \r Temporary Irrigation \r \r Temporary irrigation will be used by the contractor to establish all plantings for one growing season as \r part of their contract.

Locate field joints as shown on accepted shop drawings, \r factory prepared so there is no job site processing of top and edge surfaces. \r � Fastenings: \r � \r For epoxy tops, secure to cabinets with epoxy cement applied at each corner and along \r perimeter edges of not more than 48 inches on center. \r 04 � \r For other types of top, use concealed clamping devices for field joints, located within 6 inches \r of front, at back edges and at intervals not exceeding 24 inches. Tighten in accordance with \r manufacturer's instructions to exert a constant, heavy clamping pressure at joints. Secure to \r cabinets with �Z�-type fasteners or equivalent, using two or more fasteners at each front, end, \r and back. \r � Workmanship: Abut top and edge surfaces in one true plane, with internal supports placed to \r prevent any deflection. Provide flush hairline joints in top units using clamping devices. At epoxy \r material joints, use manufacturer's recommended adhesives and holding devices to provide joint \r widths not more than 1/16-inch wide at any location, completely filled and flush with abutting \r edges. \r � \r Where necessary to penetrate tops with fasteners, countersink heads approximately 1/8-inch \r and plug hole flush with material equal in chemical resistance, color, hardness, and texture to \r top surface. \r � \r After installation, carefully dress joints smooth, remove any surface scratches, clean and \r polish entire surface. \r � \r Provide holes and cutouts as required for mechanical and electrical service fixtures. \r � \r Provide scribe moldings for closures at junctures of top, curb and splash with walls as \r recommended by manufacturer for materials involved. Use chemical-resistant, permanent-\r elastic sealing compound where recommended by manufacturer. \r � \r The edge condition will be square cut for butt joint to adjacent tops. The front edge must be a \r 1/4-inch bevel. \r","keywords":[{"text":"feet-0 inches","relevance":0.65453},{"text":"Tops of cases","relevance":0.578537},{"text":"31-inch-high wall cases","relevance":0.576512},{"text":"feet-6 inches","relevance":0.575853},{"text":"dust panels","relevance":0.573321},{"text":"Vacuum Pump Storage Cabinet","relevance":0.57272},{"text":"Base Units","relevance":0.567024},{"text":"Bottoms \r of cases","relevance":0.564594},{"text":"steel panel","relevance":0.56105},{"text":"portion of laboratory casework units","relevance":0.559542},{"text":"Table Frames","relevance":0.554295},{"text":"work surface","relevance":0.553046},{"text":"glass doors","relevance":0.551932},{"text":"column covers","relevance":0.550052},{"text":"web frames","relevance":0.549811},{"text":"Modular dimensioned system of core","relevance":0.546779},{"text":"drawer sides","relevance":0.543024},{"text":"11-gauge","relevance":0.541793},{"text":"panel style support structures","relevance":0.539841},{"text":"Shelf adjustment holes","relevance":0.536106},{"text":"End panels","relevance":0.535112},{"text":"49-inch","relevance":0.534247},{"text":"84-inch-high cases","relevance":0.532513},{"text":"Physical Resistance of Finish","relevance":0.529706},{"text":"Base cabinets","relevance":0.529314},{"text":"Installation of Scientific Laboratory Furniture","relevance":0.52857},{"text":"49-inch-high wall cases","relevance":0.528347},{"text":"keyed different locks","relevance":0.527655},{"text":"Stainless-Steel Casework Fabrication","relevance":0.527546},{"text":"steel base","relevance":0.526556}],"concepts":[{"text":"Steel","relevance":0.954168},{"text":"Inch","relevance":0.951666},{"text":"Door","relevance":0.677452},{"text":"Stainless steel","relevance":0.589874},{"text":"Length","relevance":0.563813},{"text":"United States customary units","relevance":0.485404},{"text":"Imperial units","relevance":0.476541},{"text":"Foot","relevance":0.428849},{"text":"Yard","relevance":0.42479},{"text":"United States Cabinet","relevance":0.417365},{"text":"Cabinets","relevance":0.408348},{"text":"Square inch","relevance":0.396836},{"text":"Prime","relevance":0.37496},{"text":"Frame and panel","relevance":0.366049},{"text":"SI base unit","relevance":0.363051},{"text":"Cabinet","relevance":0.325988},{"text":"The Cabinet","relevance":0.321316}]}]
